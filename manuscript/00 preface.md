# Preface

This is not a book for complete beginners to lisp, Haskell or programming language implementation in general.

The reason I'm writing this book is because I perceived a gap between beginner-oriented books like Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours and dense, advanced ones like SICP, Let over Lambda and Lisp in Small Pieces.

It picks up where Write Yourself a Scheme ends, covering advanced topics like continuations, reader macro's, modules and stacktraces.
In a sense, this is the book I wish I had after finishing the former.

My goal is not to simply spew out technical facts, or immediately make you more productive with a certain technology.
Instead, I will guide you trough the entire implementation, and enlighten you with the general principles behind every feature and decision along the way.

It should also be concise, beautiful, and clear.
Existing textbooks are notoriously dense.

I want to write this book to last, even after the underlying technology becomes long obsolete.
Lisp has stood the test of time, and so should a good book, computer science or otherwise.

I wish you all the best when reading this book, 
and hope it will help you on your quest to discover the truth and beauty behind Lisp, computation and everything.
